"Exploring the Creative Process of Generative Art"

My approach to creating generative artwork typically involves a well-defined idea, concept, and end goal. However, for this particular project, I decided to abandon preconceived notions and embrace an exploratory mindset. Instead of starting with a clear vision, I began by delving into the world of flow fields.

"Diving into Flow Fields"

In generative art, a flow field assigns a value or set of values to each point in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, representing properties like direction, velocity, density, or temperature, based on the desired visual effect.

Flow fields are widely used in generative art to create dynamic and organic-looking patterns and shapes, such as swirling clouds or flowing water. To generate flow fields, artists can use various mathematical functions, including Perlin noise. Once defined, flow fields influence the movement and behavior of particles or graphic elements, creating a sense of fluidity and motion that can be captivating.

Flow fields can serve as both a theme and a technique in generative art, as they are a recurring subject or motif that artists can explore and incorporate into their work, and a tool or method that artists can use to generate visual output. As a result, flow fields offer artists a versatile medium for creative expression.

"Technique"

To generate a specific vision, manipulating a flow field can pose significant challenges. For this particular project, I adopted an exploratory approach, primarily focused on achieving a smooth, flowing aesthetic commonly associated with flow fields in generative art. However, I also aimed to create a unique piece, which prompted me to develop the idea of a distance modifier.

In the initial stages of the project, I experimented with distance functions, modifying the magnitude of the flow field by measuring the distance between specific points and an origin. I then applied different mathematical functions to these distances, incorporated them into the vector for the flow fields movement, and made more adjustments until I obtained the final outcome.

Fine-tuning these math equations can be a tedious process. Nonetheless, experimenting with code remains one of the most enjoyable aspects of working with flow fields, as making minor modifications to math functions can result in a vast array of exciting results.


"Colors"

In selecting palettes for this project, I initially relied on my personal preference and chose colors from an RGB color selector. Subsequently, I complemented those colors with intuition until I was satisfied with the overall result. However, after receiving feedback on the colors, I realized the need for further fine-tuning.

During the refinement process, I paid close attention to the cohesiveness of the palettes as a collection, which involved reducing the number of colors and precisely placing them in the artwork. This approach allowed me to achieve an aesthetic reminiscent of a canvas with color splashes, while also enhancing the sense of unity among the pieces in the collection.

"Assembly"

From a technical standpoint, using modified distance functions to generate the vectors of points in the flow field is a unique approach that sets it apart from traditional techniques.

Conceptually, viewing flow fields as a theme rather than a technique is an intriguing departure from the norm. Starting with a theme can unlock new visual possibilities and facilitate the creation of a more cohesive and meaningful piece of art.

Aesthetically, the resulting flow field produced by this approach is distinctly different from the typical flow field. The intricate patterns and illusion of shape packing create a visually striking effect that is unique to this method, further setting it apart.

The interesting shapes or "entities" that comprise the artwork appear to be assembling themselves in a dynamic and cohesive manner. This interpretation inspired the selection of the title, which aptly captures the essence of the work and invites viewers to interpret it in their own unique way.

The original concept of Entangled was inspired by text art, also known as ASCII art. I wanted to create something which had characteristics of text art, but without using any text to create it. This concept evolved drastically and the finished product only has a minor connection to ASCII, that being the pattern displayed in the background of the artwork, which is made up of hash marks combined with noise.

For me, the final product of any generative piece never fully represents my initial vision. Throughout the creation process I do a lot of experimentation, this often has unexpected results which sometimes I find appealing. For Entangled, one of these happy accidents was what I am calling "abstract growth" , which also inspired the title of the series. This abstract growth started as small weeds, but through experimenting with random values, created these long abstract lines that became entangled with the rest of the composition.

I experimented with a lot of different compositions, less trees, more flowers/ plant species, but none if it felt right. I thought of the concept of being Entangled with nature and decided the trees should be the main focus, where the branches could wind around and fill the majority of the space. Adding more nature to the ground layer distracted a lot from the trees so I decided to make the ground simplistic and focus more on filling the canvas with the leaves. This created more space in the ground layer to see some basic geometry which gives a nice contrast between the unpredictable lines of nature and the structured shapes which fill the ground. 

Working with colors is always the hardest part of any project for me. I like to add a lot of color palettes to give a large variety to the collection. This does take away from the cohesiveness of the collection in its entirety, but gives a lot more options for collectors to find one they really enjoy.

The existing nature grows on the unexisting spirits.

Generative sketch, based on the pen and ink drawings of Po Sheng Chen. Po Sheng Chen is an Architect who has drawn nothing but Architecture for over 25 years. He tried to explore something different from his previous style (Brutalism with Magical Realism), so developed his own Minimalist Architecture process and style. After breaking up all the complicated elements and symbols, he chose a simple and naive way to present “pure volumes in the space (the essential of Architecture)”: the Use of different densities of vertical lines to create different faces of volumes, with the addition of horizontal lines to create shadows on the volumes. Shadow determined the form of volumes, then they became a clear composition in the space, Eliminating chaos. These lines seem like spirits to Po Sheng Chen, because they represent the soul of Architecture, but they do not have a specific form or meaning...they are between existing and unexisting! Tezumie is a creative generative artist. He saw the latest experimental drawings of Po Sheng Chen, and after reaching out, the collab was formed with the goal of creating a digital representation of the original concept surrounded by a natural and overgrown environment. The combination of nature and architecture.

My name is Tezumie, and I'm an artist based in the United States. I specialize in generative art, illustration, and pixel art, and I enjoy exploring different styles and techniques. My focus is on creating semi-realistic scenes and experimenting with abstract concepts, often drawing inspiration from nature.

Working within a creative community is an essential part of my process, and I value the feedback and advice of my peers. For me, the artistic journey is just as meaningful as the final product, and I find motivation in collaborating with others. I'm passionate about coding with natural themes, as it presents a fun challenge and allows me to create art that resonates with others, as it is recognizable rather than abstract.

Generative art has been in existence for quite some time, although it has recently gained widespread recognition. This art form employs algorithms and code to generate dynamic and distinctive pieces of art. I am captivated by its approach, which presents exciting challenges and pushes traditional art forms to their limits. The vast potential of generative art inspires me, and I eagerly anticipate witnessing its evolution over time.
